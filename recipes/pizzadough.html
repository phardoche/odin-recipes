        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Poolish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>300 ml water (tempered)</li>
            <li>300 gr flour (sieved) </li>
            <li>5 gr dry yeast</li>
            <li>5 gr honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 poolish recipe (all)</li>
            <li>700 ml water (tempered)</li>
            <li>1250 gr flour</li>
            <li>40 gr salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>For the poolish</h4>
        <p><em>At least 48 hours prior to pizza cooking</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add lukewarm water in a recipient with a lid.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the honey in the water.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast and stir to dissolve in the sugared water.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and stir briefly until homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Snap the lid and leave at room temperature (summer) or in the oven warmed for a short time (start oven only to feel the heat coming from burner).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For the dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl (preferably with a lid), add the water and gently stir in the poolish with a spatula.</li>Add the flour in 3 to 4 steps, stirring to mix it all with the liquid.
            <li>When half the flour is incorporated, add the salt (adding the salt directly to the poolish may harm the yeast).</li>
            <li>When it is no longer possible to mix with the spatula, transfer the dough to a clean surface and knead with the hands, folding the dough to incorporate air for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The dough will be quite sticky, cover with the bowl for 15 minutes and let it rest.</li>
            <li>Cover your hands with a little bit of olive oil, scrape the dough from the counter and fold it for 3 to 4 times by lifting by the middle with both hands, in order to create a balloon and stretch the surface until it is smooth and strong. <em><strong>From this moment, the top of the dough must remain on top for all steps until the end.</strong></em></li>
            <li>Scrape any bits of flour or dried dough from the bowl and cover all its surface with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>Drop the dough in the bowl and cover for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough in equal parts and shape the dough balls by keeping the top on top, folding the outer part under it.</li>
            <li>Gently put the balls in a big plastic tray with a lid (a piece of parchemin paper for each ball will prevent them to stick together when they expand).</li>
            <li>Keep the tray in the fridge until the day of cooking. Take it out of the fridge at least for hour before shaping and cooking. I recommend to unclip the lid and to place a towel over the tray to absorb humidity. If the tray is shallow, cut a parchemin paper the size of the tray to put on top of the dough balls under the towel.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At that point, the dough balls can be frozen on a pan then kept in the freezer in a sealed bag or ziploc.</p>
